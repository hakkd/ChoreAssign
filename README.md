# ChoreAssign

## An application for assigning and tracking household chores

This application will help members of a household divide and assign chores. Chores may need to be completed on 
different intervals, for example:
- feeding a pet (daily)
- taking out the garbage (weekly) 
- cleaning the fridge (monthly) 

This application will allow users to define chores with intervals on which they should be completed and time required. 
Users can then add household members and can assign chores manually, or have the program assign them such that the time 
commitment is balanced.

This application could be useful to anyone who shares a home with roommates, their significant 
other, their family, or anyone else. My motivation for this project comes from my own household, where my partner and I
often discuss how to divide chores and remember how often they will be done.
