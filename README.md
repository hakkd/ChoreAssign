# ChoreAssign

## An application for managing household chores

This application will help members of a household divide, assign and remember recurring chores. Chores 
may need to be completed on different intervals, for example:

- feeding a pet (daily)
- taking out the garbage (weekly)
- cleaning the fridge (monthly)

This application will allow users to define chores with intervals on which they should be completed and the time to
complete the chore on the specified interval. Users can then add household members and manage chores assigned to each 
household member. Users will also be able to view their household members and the chores assigned to each. 
This will help users remember and track what chores they and others in their household are responsible for. 

This application could be useful to anyone who shares a living space with roommates, their significant
other, their family, or anyone else. My motivation for this project comes from my own household, where my partner and I
often discuss how to divide chores and how often they will be done.
