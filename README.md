# ChoreAssign

## An application for assigning and tracking household chores

This application will help members of a household divide and assign chores on a monthly basis. Chores may need to be
completed on different intervals, for example:

- feeding a pet (daily)
- taking out the garbage (weekly)
- cleaning the fridge (monthly)

This application will allow users to define chores with intervals on which they should be completed and time required.
Users can then add household members and can assign chores to them. Users will be able to view their 
household members and the chores assigned to each. This will help users remember and track what chores they and others 
in their household are responsible for. 

This application could be useful to anyone who shares a home with roommates, their significant
other, their family, or anyone else. My motivation for this project comes from my own household, where my partner and I
often discuss how to divide chores and how often they will be done.
